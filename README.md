# Coding-Challenge
This is a repo on the Hi-Yield 'coding challenge'

Hi Justin (or whoever is reading this:)) This is my attempt of the Hi-Yield Coding challenges.

All of the areas of the task I have not touched on before (associative arrays, wordpress or tailwindCSS) but I actually quite enjoyed
them.

If I have completed any of the tasks incorrectly or misunderstood them, just send me an email and I will re-attempt the challenges that I messed up on.

Thank you for taking the time to read through them.

Logan:)
